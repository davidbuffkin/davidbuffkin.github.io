                    <h1 style="font-family:Didot">Hey! I'm David.</h1>
                    <p>Right now I'm studying at Carnegie Mellon to get 
                        my bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Luckily, this coincides pretty well with my endgame; I'd like nothing more
                        than to do some neat, innovative research in cutting-edge AI techniques.
                        I am particularly interested in the topic of <i>neuroevolution</i>, the application of 
                        genetic (or otherwise evolutionary) algorithms to effeciently search for effective 
                        architectures, parameters or topology of artificial neural networks. To me, it seems like the
                        best way to mimic creating human intelligence is to... well, mimic creating human intelligence; and
                        even Darwin knew we came about through a genetic algorithm of our own. I have some ideas, and I'm excited
                        to explore them in the near future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides that, I like to engage in a pretty varied set of activites, from rock climbing and waterpolo 
                        to billiards and karaoke (that was, before 2020). In my free time I often write up a cool little video game 
                        or some other idea I had buzzing around. I guess making new stuff is kinda addictive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To see some of my projects, take a scroll down memory lane with me.

                        The simulation program is designed to be integrated into a ROS network 
                        where an autonomous agent can control various aspects of the simulation
                        (the actuators are a water pump, fans, and light) based on information
                        it recieves (the sensors are temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.). In this way,
                        it is meant to be used to test the autonomous growth of plants.
                        The simulation of the environment is robust and responsive, taking into account
                        the time of day for sunlight, modelling real-world hydrologic interactions, 
                        growing the plants realistically based on the simulated environment, and much more.

                        Everything you see I wrote or created. I created the 3D models for the terrarium its parts in Blender,
                        I wrote the python necessary to render them, I linked the interaction of the program to ROS and other agents, and
                        I modelled the mathematics necessary to make the plants grow realistically - both the geometry involved in shaping
                         the plants, and the interaction with environmental factors to adjust plant growth.

                        Don't know what you want to listen to? Spotiface does. Just take a picture of your face
                        and Spotiface will generate you a Spotify playlist based on your current mood and 
                        your preexisting music taste. It's quick and easy-just snap a picture and the face analysis
                        will automatically process-and your unique playlist will show up right in your Spotify
                        account ready for you to enjoy. And, if you want music you haven't heard before, just close your
                        eyes and we will pick some unseen music for you!

                        Music is best enjoyed when it fits your mood. Now, you can enjoy music anytime,

                        Spotiface was the product of HackMIT 2020 by me and three friends from high school. 
                        Generally, we all worked at least a bit on each part, but I specialized in getting the face
                        detection setup and integrated, linking with the Spotify web API, the playlist generation algorithm,
                        and a bit of design work. The app is written in React Native, using the Expo client.

                        While at first the project was a bit of a gimmick, I have actually found it quite
                        useful, and I do plan to continue working on it (or a new version) for production.
